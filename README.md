# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

## Hosted Demo link: 
```bash
https://zelthy-assignment-delta.vercel.app/
```

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Instructions
To run the React code with Vite, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jishanpathan7/zelthy-assignment
```
Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd ./zelthy-assignment
```
Install Dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the Development Server:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the Vite development server. You can access your React application at http://localhost:3000.

Start Coding!
Once the development server is running, you can start coding your React application. Any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser thanks to Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

Build for Production:
When you're ready to deploy your React application, you can build it for production using:

```bash
Copy code
npm run build
```
This will generate an optimized build of your application in the dist directory.
